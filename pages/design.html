        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>The visualization consists of several parts: <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Single-Bar Charts</li>
            <li>Stacked Bar Chart</li>
            <li>Map</li>
            <li>Scatter Plot</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p><h3><b>Colors</b></h3>
        The color of the data representations always represents the nation that initiated the explosion.
        the colors were chosen to represent the different factions during the cold war. A legend
        can be found under the visualization.
        </p>
        <p><h3><b>Single-Bar Charts</b></h3>
        Single bars representing the amount of nuclear weapon explosions or accumulated yield of the selected
        data points. The data is ordered to group nations of the same factions. The plot reacts on the filtering
        possibilities described below and allows to summarize the data selection.
        </p>
        <p><h3><b>Stacked Bar Chart</b></h3>
        The stacked bar chart shows the distribution of nuclear weapon explosion count or yield for every year per
        nation. The user can choose between an absolute or relative scale and whether to show the count or the yield
        by pressing the buttons in the upper right corner.
        </p>
        <p><h3><b>Map</b></h3>
        The countries who performed nuclear weapon tests are marked with their respective color. The borders
        actually represent their modern course. Thus the UDSSR is represented by Russia. The plotted circles
        represent the single nuclear weapon explosion. The size of the circles encodes the yield of the bomb
        in a linear scale.
        </p>
        <p><h3><b>Scatter Plot</b></h3>
        In the scatter plot the single nuclear weapon explosions are plotted over time against yield. The yield
        is additionally encoded by circle size in the same fashion as on the map. The y-Axis was scaled logarithmic
        to allow for an overall better distribution of the data points. The yield of data points containing an
        unknown yield or a yield of 0 was substituted with 0.0001, which is lower than all other data points,
        to be able to calculate the logarithm.
        </p>
        <p><h3><b>Interactivity</b></h3>
        The visualization is highly interactive. In the control form under the visualization the scale of the
        circle sizes can be adjusted by changing the maximum and minimum sizes. Additionally data points can be
        filtered by time and yield using the respective form elements or by selecting the data points in the
        scatter plot by drawing a frame around them. The countries can be deselected and selected by clicking
        on the respective circles in the legend. For convenience buttons to select or deselect all data points
        were added.
        Hovering over data points on the map or scatter plot opens a tooltip with additional information and
        highlights the data point in both the scatter plot and map.
        </p>
