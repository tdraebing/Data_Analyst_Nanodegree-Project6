    <h4>Martin (Udacity Forums)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>I understand from your description that you chose the colors (for the US and UDSSR, I guess) according to the
            Cold War factions - however they don't seem intuitive to me. Also, there are many more countries coming up
            that can't really get justified according to this, so then it altogether becomes a bit unclear why which color.</li>
        <p class="red">Martin is right in that I chose the colors according to the Cold War factions. Blue-ish colors for the Allied forces,
        red-ish for Communist forces and green-ish colors for India and Pakistan, since these two countries represent their
        own conflict. I actually do not know how to improve this, since I think random colors are even less intuitive and
        actually would mean a loss of visualized information. To improve intuitiveness I will add my reasoning to the description.</p>

        <li>Secondly, the colors are somewhat "grayish". You probably chose to not make them too bright because that would
            be confusing, but maybe you could try using opacity instead of how it's now.</li>
        <p class="red">I chose the 'grayish' colors for exactly that reason. Before doing so I actually tried working with opacity, but
        that turned out to not work very well. But it is probably also a matter of taste.</p>

        <li>I'd put the legend at the start. I think it's easier to orientate going down the visualizations if you have
            the understanding of which color is which country (and that colors represent countries) upfront.</li>
        <p class="red">Done.</p>

        <li>Here I don't really have a suggestion right away (I'll come back to you in case I come up with something).
            I think it's good that you structured the information so that there's not too much writing on the main page
            at any point, distracting from the visualizations.
            However, I found it kind of confusing to be clicking the tabs and seeing only the text change, but the page
            jump around (because of the different lengths). It kind of made the expectation that there would be different
            pages, while only the text changed.
            I thought of using a modal box, but I think it's good that you can have each text and explore the visualization
            alongside. Maybe you could try using a fixed-size window for the text (with scrolling), so that only the content
            of that frame would change (the different texts), and avoid the jumping around of the rest of the content.
            This would maybe make it more straightforward what is going on. : )</li>
        <p class="red">I changed the complete layout of the webpage. Using a menu instead of a tab based layout and creating a single page
        for each part of the report should have improved the overall structure.</p>

        <li>I would try to make the buttons more obvious from within the visualization. There should be no need to read
            in order to find them (other people might find them anyways, but since I didn't, there are surely also some
            others who won't)</li>
        <p class="red">Since I do not want to overload the visualization with big buttons, I tried to tackle this problem in a different way.
        The overall intuitiveness seems to be pretty ba. There is a lot going on and reading and searching a long text
        might not be what a user might do. So I added a frame with a short help text for each part of the visualization,
        that can be toggled with a button on top.</p>

        <li>Maybe you could have the absolute amount of explosions as the starting graph. This might be a personal choice,
            but I find that one more interesting as the first thing to see, and the relative one if I want to explore further.</li>
        <p class="red">I decided to use the relative representation, since the dynamic range of the data is huge, which leads to very small
        bars for most years, which again in my opinion gives slightly less information on a first glance. Thus I kept it
        that way.</p>

        <li>yep, a possibility to zoom in would be great, because there are often many points on the same spots</li>
        <p class="red">That is definitely a thing I would like to implement, but also a very complicated thing to do taking into account
        that the different visualizations are connected. Thus (at least for now) I did not implement it.</p>

        <li>Maybe there is no need to put all the information into the tooltip, but instead choose some that you find more
            interesting and relevant. Many things could be encoded differently (e.g. yield by size of circle; country is
            already clear and so is longitude and latitude (by the map position)); So I would keep name, date and explosion
            medium - and yield I'd try to encode in circle size.</li>
        <p class="red">I removed the coordinates and countries from the tooltips. I left the yield, since I am not completely happy
        with the encoding in circle size so far.</p>

        <li>For me it wasn't clear that I could select a country to display only the explosions associated to the country selected.
            It's a very cool feature (because I think the scatterplot is otherwise a bit overloaded). I guess that's also
            the reason why you have the "legend" at the bottom. But maybe it's fair to have these two functionalities separate
            (legend vs. button for scatterplot).</li>
        <p class="red">The help frame should also help with this issue.</p>

        <li>The option to select more countries and compare the dots is interesting, but through the fact that any that
            are not selected are grayed out, it becomes difficult to understand what is what. Why did you choose not to
            make them keep their colors? This would feel more intuitive to me.</li>
        <p class="red">This is actually what I tried first. While it helps with keeping the information of the country
        of origin after selection, it makes it difficult to determine which points in the border region of the brush
            are selected and which not. I am not sure about this and will keep it in mind. It is definitely a valid point.</p>

        <li>Also: I didn't understand how to work with the "Circle Size" option (or any of the options, really).
            But maybe they are not yet fully implemented.</li>
        <p class="red">I removed it. See statement in the beginning of this section.</p>

        <li>I figured out eventually that the date is by default set to only one day in 1944 - instead of to the full
            available time span. This is, however, what I would have expected the setting to be (considering that this
            is also what the graphs are showing on first load of the page!)</li>
        <p class="red">Fixed.</p>

        <h4>John Enyeart (Google+)</h4>

        <li>As far as the visualization, it took me a little while to realize how to interact with it. I like the idea
            of being able to select based on time and yield, but it wasn't obvious that I needed to draw a rectangle to
            do so. It might help if you had some text on each graphic with simple explanations of how to interact with it.
        </li>
        <p class="red">Should be dealt with by implementing the help frame.</p>

        <li>Also, it might be interesting to add a scroll bar at the bottom of either the map or the yield/year plot so
            that you can scroll through time and see all the tests done in a certain year (which would kind of be mimicking
            the Isao Hashimoto video, but more interactive).</li>
        <p class="red">I added an animation mode that allows for that.</p>

        <li>
            As far as using the log scale for the explosions, I'm not sure if there's any way around it, but maybe you
            could play around with other transformations like square root. Also, maybe you could make the visualization
            on the map some combination of size and color intensity based on the yield.</li>
        <p class="red">So far I could not find a really good transformation. And using color intensity would not help, I
        think, since most users would not notice and it might be hard to distinguish between intensities, especially
            since there are already quite some colors.</p>
